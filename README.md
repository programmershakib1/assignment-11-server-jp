# Task Management API (Server Side)

## Short Description

This is the backend API for the Task Management application. It provides functionalities for managing tasks with features like task creation, deletion, updating, categorization, and task order management. The server is built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. It supports authentication via Firebase and ensures secure and efficient task management through API endpoints.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies are used in the server-side of the project:

- **Express.js**: A fast, unopinionated web framework for Node.js to handle routing and server-side logic.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used for storing and managing application data.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: For secure authentication and authorization.
- **Cors**: A package used to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in the server.
- **dotenv**: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env` for configuration management.

## Dependencies
